            <p> Hicks Law of Design refers to choices. Every addition choice that you have
                requires additional time to make a decision. Keeping this in mind, it is easy
                to see that Trivago takes the guess work out of where to start. It is easy to navigate and 
                find additional information, but the main purpose of their site is to help you find a place to stay
                when traveling, and that fact is clear as you look at their home page.

            <h2>Repetition</h2>

            <p>In-N-Out Burger's website is a good example of the design principle repetition.
                Each icon is placed in a grid pattern that is centered, as well as evenly spaced, 
                creating a visually pleasing design. Icons have been created that are uniform in size, 
                and color, reinforcing the repetition on this page. Repetition in the color red, 
                their signature color, also adds to the appeal of this design.

            <h2>Alignment</h2>

            <p>Minted's website has many examples of good use of design principles. The left alignment of the text 
                is interesting and adds to the cleanliness of the overall design. Another interesting aspect of this site 
                is the difference between the desktop layout and mobile layout. On the desktop it is laid out in a two 
                column grid, but each section is a different size, unified by complimentary background colors and left aligned text. 
                The mobile view has one column with each section being the same size. <br>Simplicity at it's best.
