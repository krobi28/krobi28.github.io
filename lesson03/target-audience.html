        <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The goal at Weather You Like it or Not is to have a target audience that is very broad. 
                The information we supply will help the user understand the weather as they plan their daily routine.
                Knowing what the weather has in store is not something to worry about. We will give you an accurate forcast,
                weather you like it or not.
            </p>

        <h3>Personas</h3>    

        <h2>Jane Smith</h2>
        <p>Jane is 32 and has three children ages nine, six and four. Her husband works full time
            as a financial adviser allowing Jane to work from home as a full time CEO to her family. She
            is an expert chef, nurse, organizer, travel agent, and personal shopper and often checks the weather
            to determine the right apparel for everyone in her household. Park play dates are also a priority in the
            Smith
            home, so accurate weather forcasts are a must. </p>
   
            <h2>Matt Clark</h2>
            <p>Matt is sod farmer in Preston Idaho. He lives with his wife and four children outside of
                town on many acres of land. Matt enjoys the planning and work involved as he plants and
                maintains each new field of grass. It is important for Matt to have the accurate weather
                forecast so he can calculate water usage in his fields. He also needs to determine available work
                days for not only growing, but harvesting and installs as well.
            </p>

        <h3>Senarios</h3>  
        
        <ul>
            <li>Jane is planning a birthday party for her oldest daughter next week. Since it is May,
                she would like an outdoor party but she will need to check Weather You Like it or Not
                to determine the rain forecast for next week.</li><br>
            <li>Matt was just notified that a large order for fresh sod has been placed. He know that 
                the expected delivery date is two weeks from tomorrow. When he checks Weather You Like it or Not
                he finds that their accurate fifteen day forecast will assist him with scheduling and harvest.</li><br>
            <li>Jane really wants to walk to church today, but dark clouds seem to be forming out of nowhere. 
                A quick check of Weather You Like it or Not will let her know what time the rain will fall, making
                her decision to walk to church quick and easy.</li><br>
            <li>Matt is getting ready to plant a new sod field, but he notices the wind has been heavy as of late.
                He knows that if the wind gusts at too high of levels, the seed will blow away and not germinate as 
                it should, resulting in a patchy, undesirable product. He turns to Weather You Like it or Not because 
                he knows he can trust the accuracy of the current and forecasted wind speed listed there.</li><br>
            <li>Jane has been up late cleaning out a closet when she realizes that she needs to drive the kids to 
                school early the next morning. As she is preparing for bed she notices that it has started to snow
                outside. She wonders if school will be cancelled tomorrow due to snow conditions so she checks Weather 
                You Like it or not and determines heavy snow is forecasted all night long. She decides to keep cleaning 
                the closet because she has confidence that Weather You Like it or Not is accurate and school will be 
                cancelled in the morning. </li><br>    
        </ul>
