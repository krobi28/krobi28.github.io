            <picture>
                <img class="logo" src="/lesson03/images/WeatherLikeorNotLogo.gif" alt="Weather You Like it or Not icon/Logo">
            </picture>
            <p>This logo was created by Karen Robison using two different icons found
                on iconfinder.com. The sun icon indicates this is a website for weather purposes. 
                The thumbs up icon is a universal sybol for "like". The slash through the sun is the
                universal symbol for stop, no, or not. When all these elements are displayed together, there
                is a good picture representation of "Weather You Like it or Not" 
                <br> <h5>Both the sun icon, and the thumbs up icon are liscensed free 
                for commercial use.</h5>
            </p>
